Human reference mtdna sequence in Python formats.

oldowan.mtdna contains the human revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) in
Python friendly formats.

Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is pure Python and has no dependencies outside of the standard
library. The easist way to install is using ``easy_install`` from the
setuptools_ package.  This usually goes something like this::

	$ easy_install oldowan.mtdna

or on a unix-like system, assuming you are installing to the main Python
``site-packages`` directory as a non-privileged user, this::

	$ sudo easy_install oldowan.mtdna

You may also use the standard python distutils setup method. Download the
current source archive from the file list towards the bottom of this page,
unarchive it, and install. On Mac OS X and many other unix-like systems, having
downloaded the archive and changed to the directory containing this archive in
your shell, this might go something like::

	$ tar xvzf oldowan.mtdna*
	$ cd oldowan.mtdna*
	$ python setup.py install

Quick Start
===========

This package provides the human rCRS in several Python friendly formats.

  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import rCRS
  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import rCRSlist
  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import rCRSplus
  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import rCRSplus_positions

``rCRS`` is the raw sequence as a string::

  >>> len(rCRS)
  16569
  >>> rCRS[0:10]
  'GATCACAGGT'

``rCRSlist`` is the rCRS sequence broken into a list. NOTE that this list is
padded with a nonsense character in position 0 such that the indices match the
standard biologial sequence position numbering (i.e. starting at 1 rather than
0)::

  >>> rCRSlist[0]
  '#'
  >>> rCRSlist[1]
  'G'

``rCRSplus`` is a partially repeat of the rCRS sequence. Because the mtDNA molecule is circular, it cannot be properly represented by a linear string. This might not be that big of an issue if experimentally derived mtDNA sequences generally do not span the break, BUT as it happens, the most commonly sequenced region of the mitochondrial genome (the control region) spans the point where the circular sequence is conventionally broken for the linear sequence. Thus, ``rCRSplus`` repeats 1000bp on either end of the molecule to facilitate sequence alignment across the break. The ``rCRSplus_positions`` list remaps the indices of ``rCRSplus`` onto the conventional position numbering of the rCRS.

  >>> len(rCRSplus)
  18638
  >>> rCRSplus[1]
  'A'
  >>> rCRSlist[1]
  'G'
  >>> rCRSlist[rCRSplus_positions[1]]
  'A'

Finally, the oldowan.mtdna package provides indices to extract common mtDNA regions from the rCRS.

  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import HVR1_indices
  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import HVR2_indices
  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import HVR1and2_indices
  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import HVR1to2_indices
  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import coding_indices
  >>> from oldowan.mtdna import all_indices
  
  >>> hvr1 = ''.join(list(rCRSlist[x] for x in HVR1_indices))

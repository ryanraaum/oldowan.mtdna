Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is pure Python and has no dependencies outside of the standard
library. The easist way to install is using ``easy_install`` from the
setuptools_ package.  This usually goes something like this::

	$ easy_install oldowan.mtdna

or on a unix-like system, assuming you are installing to the main Python
``site-packages`` directory as a non-privileged user, this::

	$ sudo easy_install oldowan.mtdna

You may also use the standard python distutils setup method. Download the
current source archive from the file list towards the bottom of this page,
unarchive it, and install. On Mac OS X and many other unix-like systems, having
downloaded the archive and changed to the directory containing this archive in
your shell, this might go something like::

	$ tar xvzf oldowan.mtdna*
	$ cd oldowan.mtdna*
	$ python setup.py install
